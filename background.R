#                      Due to a failure in scientific communication, many believed that using opioids to treat chronic pain was not addictive. This turned out not to be the case, as many 
#                      patients abused the drugs, becoming increasingly dependent. In response, doctors have started limiting their opioid prescribing practices. While this may be beneficial
